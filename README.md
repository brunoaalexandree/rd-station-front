## About the project

This project was made for a test by RD Station.

This is a simple project where the user will fill in some data in a step-by-step form and based on their preferences they will have some recommended products.
I didn't have access to any UI/UX files provided by RD Station, so I developed the layout in Figma and then developed the code.

## Challenges

- Initially I received the entire project in Javascript, so I converted the entire project to Typescript.
- Since I didn't have access to any UI/UX files, I had to develop them to be able to outline a flow for the user.
- The challenge only said that I would have to recommend products, but it didn't explicitly state how I could do this. So I decided to do this using AdArencia, which consists of the following formula:

So that's it, folks! ❤️
